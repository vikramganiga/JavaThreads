What is difference need to the use of Synchronized key Vs Lock?
 
 Lock interface has methods tryLock(), tryLock(time period), - it helps program the acquire the lock.
 Lock is explicit locking mechanism. 
 
 
ReentrantLock increment an internal count of the number of nested lock requests. 
Calls to the unlock method decrement the count. The lock is not freed until the lock count reaches the zeros.
Similar Synchronized keyword. 

Nested lock required for handling the cross-calling methods.  It is possible for a method of one class to call methods of 
of another class, which in turn may call method of the origin class. If java did not support nested locks and the methods 
of the both classes were synchronized we could deadlock the program.

ReentrantLock gives count of nested call, number of acquisitions that the current thread has made on lock.
